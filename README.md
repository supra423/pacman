This is my attempt in remaking the original pacman in Rust!

I used the Macroquad library crate! It is pretty good
for retro-style 2D games and surprisingly easy. This is also
my very first Rust project and I'm still relatively new to game development
so plz be kind to me T_T. I'm not even sure if I'm gonna complete
this project because summer break is almost over and I'm gonna get
hella busy in University again, I just hope I'll finish this before
classes start again! A star would be nice though ;>

It is primarily available for arch linux because...

"I use Arch btw"

For other linux distros, I'm not really sure, but I think it should work perfectly!
I just don't have any way to confirm it because I have no other people I know
that use Linux (It's lonely being an Arch user tbh).

It is also available for windows (tested by a good friend of mine).

This is just a project for learning Rust and game development, I do
not intend to monetize this project so Namco please don't sue me ;(
