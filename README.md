This is my attempt in remaking the original pacman in Rust!

I used the Macroquad library crate! It is pretty good
for retro-style 2D games and surprisingly easy. This is also
my very first Rust project and I'm still relatively new to game development
so plz be kind to me T_T. I'm not even sure if I'm gonna complete
this project because summer break is almost over and I'm gonna get
hella busy in University again, I just hope I'll finish this before
classes start again! A star would be nice though ;>

If you're gonna ask about cross-platform compatibility stuff, I'm not
actually sure if this is even available for windows because...

"I use arch btw..."

but I'm pretty sure I didn't placed any platform-specific function calls
and code in the project, not to mention, Macroquad itself is cross-platform.
So I guess this is available in windows? I can't give assurance to this though lol.
I'm still not planning on making this cross-platform though because this is just a
personal project for learning Rust, but if you are willing to help me, that would be great!
